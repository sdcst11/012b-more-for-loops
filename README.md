## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #xx <Title> (Total Marks xx)

Objectives:
* Solve higher level problems involving conditional statements, for loops, breaks and tuples


### 3 Tasks
Each of these programs can be solved using a for loop with a break statement. They are not easy, but they are good practice in stretching your brain.

##### Task 1
Create a number guessing game
There is a limit of 10 guesses
The program will ask the user to enter an integer from 1 to 100
The program will then tell the user if the number is too high, too low or correct.
If the number is correct, the program will end
If the 10 guesses are used up, the program will say that the user has lost

##### Task 2
The program will ask the user for a username and a password
If the user name and password are correct, the program will
exit and say "Access Granted".
If they are not correct, the program will say "Access Denied".
There will be a maximum of 3 guesses allowed

##### Task 3
Similar to task2.py
Program will ask the user to enter their username and password
If the username is a match, see if the password is the correct one
annie's password is 12345
betty's is password
etc.
